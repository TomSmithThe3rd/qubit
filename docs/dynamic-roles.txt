* Dynamic Roles
* 
* Dynamic roles are server-specified roles that are given based on context. Their matchers use blocks similar to how custom keywords work.
* You can make dynamic roles public for anyone to take, or add roles that are given conditionally when something occurs.
* 
* Dynamic roles take three primary arguments: an event, a condition, and a role.
* 
* Event:
*	  A dynamic role event is an existing event, that when fired, will give a user the role. Some events are listed below.
*	
* Condition:
*    A condition is an "if" that checks something else when the event is fired. Some conditions are listed below.
* 
* Role:
*    Expectedly, this is the role that will be given out.
*    
* 
* Examples:
*    Member Role
*	   Gives the user a Member role on join if they are not a bot.
*      Event: join
*      Condition: !bot
*      Role: Member
*    Supporter Role on Donator level 1 Role
*     Gives the user a Supporter role when they get the Donator level 1 role.
*      Event: get Donator level 1
