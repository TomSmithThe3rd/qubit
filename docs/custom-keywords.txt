* Custom Keywords
* 
* Custom keywords are server-specified parsed actions that when a message is sent that matches a certain phrase, a designated task may undergo.
* This is specifically useful for filtering words such as swears or other confidential information.
* 
* Name:
*   The name of a custom keyword is short, with no spaces. Typically, you will want to name your keyword something like "no-f-word" or something of the sort.
* 
* Matches:
*   As explained, a keyword will only trigger if it matches a specific phrase. By default, keywords are not case sensitive.
*   You can simply specify some text and the keyword will trigger it. You could simply specify "f**k", and the bot will interpret it as such.
*   However, if you are experienced with Regex, you can use Regex by surrounding your phrase with two slashes, like /<(.*?)>/
*   If you choose to add capture groups in your Regex, they can be used as commands that will replace text with that group. (the {group #} block)
*   The regex notation ignores /<regex>/<flag>. Your regex will be executed by /<regex>/g, always.
* 
* Action:
*	 UPDATE: This portion has been renamed to "BitLang." Additional documentation is included elsewhere.
* 
*   The action of a keyword is essentially what will be said. Everything not surrounded by either form of brackets will be replied to in the channel.
*   Blocks are denoted by brackets. Typical action blocks are denoted by {}. Statements, like an if statement, are denoted by [].
*   Variables are denoted by <>. They will replace things. They have a higher priority than blocks.
*   
*   Here is an example of a few blocks and variables:
*	   {delete} - deletes the user's message
*	   {kick} - kicks the user who said the message
*	   {ban} - bans said user
*	   {dm you can put more stuff here that you want it to dm} -dms the user with the text specified
*	   <random i could say this;or this;maybe this> - replaces the block with a random variant of those specified
*	   <group 1> - replaces the block with the first capture group found in the regex, if any
*	   <content> - replaces the block with the content of the message
*	   <username> - replaces the block with the user's name
*	   <mention> - replaces the block with the user's mention
*	   
* 
* Example keywords:
*   We could have a keyword with the name "no-f-word". It matches "f**k". Its action is "{delete}Don't say that."
*   As you might have guessed, when "f**k" is said, the bot deletes the said message and responds with "Don't say that."
