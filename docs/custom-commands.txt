* 
* Custom commands work almost exactly like custom keywords, but they trigger on a set command that users can add.
* Both custom keywords and custom commands use a similar "language" arbitrarily named BitLang.
*

* 
* Action:
*  This is what BitLang will execute. See BitLang documentation for more information on how to use BitLang.
