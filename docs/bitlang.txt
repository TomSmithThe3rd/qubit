* BitLang
* 
* BitLang is a simple and easy-to-use "language" to help create custom commands and keywords within Qubit. Most administrative actions are available
* from BitLang, so you can create robust additions for your server.
* 
* BitLang strings are formed very simply, through two types of blocks: variable blocks and command blocks.
* 
* Blocks
*	Regardless of type, all blocks are structured the same. Typically, blocks are formatted like {command args}. The type of brace
*	will change based on type.
*
* Variable blocks
*	Variable blocks are blocks that look like <var args>. They replace parts of the BitLang string that contain useful information, such
*	as name, mention, server name, etc.
*
* Command blocks
*	Command blocks are blocks that do an action. They look like {command args}. They do not replace with anything; they merely do something. Combined with
*	variable blocks, command blocks can be quite powerful.
*
* 
* 
* All command blocks
*	{delete}		Deletes the sent message.
*	{ban}			Bans the user who sent the message.
*	{kick}			Kicks the user who sent the message.
*	{dm <content>}	DMs the user who sent the message with the <content> provided. Example: {dm Hey dude! How's it going?}
*	{give <role>}	Gives the user who sent the message the role specified. Example: {give Moderator}
*	{take <role>}	Takes a role from the user who sent the message. Example: {take Moderator}
*	
*
* All variable blocks
*	<content>		The content of the sent message.
*	<group <num>>	If regex was used to define this custom keyword, then replaces with the group value of the number specified. (advanced)
*	<random a;b;c>	Chooses a random string between a, b, and c. Not limited to 3 arguments.
*	<username>		The username of who sent the message.
*	<mention>		The mention of who sent the message, or the username if a webhook triggered the command/keyword.
