# Privacy Policy
By using Qubit, you agree to our Privacy Policy, which is as follows.

## Data
We collect data on you and your server. Basic information about your server, such as its ID, avatar, and name are stored for usage in the bot. Additionally, when a user uses a profile-based command, information about them such as their name, avatar, and ID are also stored.

### Third parties
Data on you and your servers that use Qubit is not shared to any external third parties, and never will be. It is only used for internal features like saving profile information and registering server-side features to your server.

### Storage
Data is stored locally where Qubit runs, not on an external server. No server runs on this physical server that may make your data easily interceptible.

## Extra notes
If you do not agree with this privacy policy, you can safely remove Qubit from your server.
