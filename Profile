**Profiles**

Profiles are a big part of the Qubit bot, letting you costumize your profile with a biograph and a status.
It also displays your current amount of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qgQrp1k.png" width="24px"/> at the time, your name with your hashtag,
your Qubit level and experience and your reputation.
Profiles are useful for expressing yourself, updating the people around you in a way that is nicely laid out and convenient,
