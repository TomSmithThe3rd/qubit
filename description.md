# Qubit
Qubit, previously known as Discoid, is an advanced yet simple bot allowing for full control over your server.

## Testimonials
Below are some closed alpha participant testimonials.

> the bot worked very well and was fun but the dev was bad at giving me free stuff. introduces a cool clan aspect to the server, lets me make cool looking announcements, and cool looking rules. also gambling. its fun. image stuff is good too

> I'd recommend Qubit because of its easy to use commands as well as its very friendly and interactive development team. I mostly like the utility commands that come with it, they're pretty unique from other bots and I personally have not seen them implemented in the way Qubit does. Now that I think of it, I don't think I've seen a majority of the commands with other bots.

> The Discord bot Qubit has truly made using Discord 1000% better with all of its features, commands and customisability. Not only is the bot great but so are the staff. They are always there to help and assist.

> I like that the bot has a lot of features and that it covers most of the needs of admins and has fun features for members of a server as well. I'd say most of its features are well-done and has a few bugs, if any, but it's expected since it's in an alpha [at time of writing]. My favorite features are probably the ones that I can create my own commands and keywords, since it allows for a lot of uses and makes things easier. And you [voximity] did an amazing job at always being there, whenever we pinged you or asked you for help you would always respond. And obviously the updates were great and I like it that they keep coming.

## Ease of use
Qubit intends to be very easy to use. All commands can be ran without any arguments, and Qubit will ask you how you want to run the command. Just use `\cmds` or `\help` to get started, and use `\help <command>` to view help on any specific command. Running any command blankly will show information about the command or ask how you'd like to set up the command.

## Features
Qubit has a wide variety of features from fun to moderation to image manipulation and clans.

### Moderation
Some of Qubit's moderation features include, but are not limited to:

- Pruning a specific set of messages, message matches, or entire channels
- Setting up user-made actions when users say something specific (custom keywords)
- Automatically hand out roles to users when events occur (dynamic roles)
- Softban, ban, kick, and rename users

### Utility
Qubit has a very large variety of utility commands. Here are just a few:

- Announcing through embeds and rules that any administrator can edit in realtime
- Changing server language (bot is translatable)
- Disable commands in certain channels
- Create custom commands that do things when ran

### Fun
Qubit has a heavy focus on fun features, such as:

- Global competitive clans
- User profiles with currency, gambling, & reputation
- Realtime image editing, generation of memes
- Access online image generators such as xkcd & cat pictures, of course

## Development
Qubit is being worked on every day. It's what I do for a passion. I'm currently working on a web dashboard for Qubit that will allow for almost every feature in the text-portion, but online.
